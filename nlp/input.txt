The National Capital Region (NCR) is a coordinated planning region centred upon the National Capital Territory of Delhi (NCT) in India. It encompasses the entire NCT of Delhi and several districts surrounding it from the states of Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan.[2] The NCR and the associated National Capital Region Planning Board were created in 1985 to plan the development of the region and to evolve harmonized policies for the control of land-uses and development of infrastructure in the region.[3] Prominent cities of NCR include Delhi, Ghaziabad, Faridabad, Gurgaon, Noida and Meerut.

The NCR is a rural-urban region, with a population of over 46,069,000 and an urbanization level of 62.6%.[1] As well as the cities and towns the NCR contains ecologically sensitive areas like the Aravalli ridge, forests, wildlife and bird sanctuaries.[4] The Delhi Extended Urban Agglomeration, a part of the NCR, contributed $370 billion or roughly 4% to the Indian economy (measured in terms of GDP PPP) in 2015-16.
